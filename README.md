# TrackTheEmployee

* I installed inquirer: 8.2.4, mysql2: 2.3.3, console.table: 0.10.0 for this project.

* I created schema.sql and seeds.sql as datafile in database(db) folder.

* I created basic tables in both schema.sql and seeds.sql

* I created server.js as main file, then require the dependencies.

* I try to have connection from server.js to sql.

* In the server.js, have fuction which prompt interactive list of options for searching and pulling out tables

* I am still trying to figure out how to make this project right.
